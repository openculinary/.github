# Contributing to RecipeRadar

Thanks for helping out with RecipeRadar!

This document provides guidance to make your contributions effective and to keep the RecipeRadar community and software safe and healthy.


## Code of Conduct

Participation in the OpenCulinary community is covered by our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/openculinary/.github/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).  Please report any unacceptable behaviour that you encounter.


## Software Components

The RecipeRadar application contains multiple software components.  Each component should have a simple name and should provide a limited set of services.

For example, the RecipeRadar [direction-parser](https://github.com/openculinary/direction-parser) accepts written recipe instructions and extracts metadata from them.  It does not determine how the metadata is displayed to the user, nor how it is stored.

Please try to determine the most relevant RecipeRadar component to provide your contributions to.  This will help our team to understand and respond to your contributions swiftly.


## Reporting Bugs

We want to hear your bug reports and get them solved for you, and we all save time if you can find and improve an existing bug report rather than writing a duplicate one.

Try [searching OpenCulinary issues](https://github.com/issues?q=org%3Aopenculinary+is%3Aissue) to check whether a bug is already reported.  If you find an existing bug report, you can add priority to it by adding a :+1: reaction on the description.

Please only comment on a bug report if your comment helps to discover or resolve the problem.


## Technical Documentation

Both reading and writing technical documentation are valuable contributions and we appreciate your help with them.

Everyone benefits when documentation is concise and comprehensive.

If you find code, components or processes in RecipeRadar that are undocumented or contain mistakes, please [offer changes](#offering-changes) and we'll review them.


## Offering Changes

By contributing changes to RecipeRadar you can alter the direction of the project and improve it for future users.

There is also a risk that you could introduce mistakes or errors that could cause problems for people.

Changes should be prepared and explained thoughtfully and carefully, and may require modification before we can accept them.  In some rare cases we may not be able to accept your changes.

All changes are subject to review by the RecipeRadar maintainers, and are visible and open to discussion by the larger RecipeRadar community.


## Developing Features

We would like to build RecipeRadar into a service that improves life for everyone.  Achieving that goal will require development of additional features as the audience grows.

To ensure that we can all co-operate and build a useful service together, it will help to avoid conflicts and to reduce unnecessary work.

Please plan and discuss your suggested features with the RecipeRadar community before you spend time writing code.

The best way to enable discussion is to [open a feature request](https://github.com/openculinary/api/issues/new?assignees=&labels=enhancement&template=feature_request.md) and to share your ideas with the RecipeRadar community.

This is a good way to gather feedback on your idea and to determine whether the community understands and agrees with your approach.
